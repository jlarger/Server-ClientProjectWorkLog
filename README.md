# Server-ClientProjectWorkLog
This repository has five .c files: finalProjClient.c, finalProjServer.c, HandleTCPClient.c, transmission.c, and HandleTCPClient.c. All five are needed to run it. Essentially, this project runs off of server/client communication. A server sends menus, the client receives the menus, and send responses back. There is a login screen and a sign-up screen that are used for logging in, and once the user logs in and is verified they are taken to their home. Once in their home, they can create a new project, edit a project, delete a project, or save a project. This is also based off of multiple text files, and threading will be added eventually. This is a work in progress.
